Layout basically places some hierarchically orginized rectangles based on their attributes.
Relevant attributes in Freeplane are
floating (boolean)
shiftX, shiftY, Vgap (numbers)
and summary (boolean)
The shifts means how a node is placed related to its "zero" position,
the Vgap means additional vertical gap for child nodes
There are also clouds which make nodes use more space depending on a cloud type and level
Filtered (hidden) content means no own content is visible (its size = (0,0)) but the chidren can be.
Children are hidden for folded nodes
Location of node content relative to its parent node does not change if folding state is changed. 

layout process:
Precondition: every child node has been layed out 
  its size is known
  its content (text/objects) and its  child nodes are layed out and put to the right positoins
Action:
  current node is layed out	 by defining bounds of its content and putting its child nodes to the right location
  Its size is calculated
  
Names:
  Tree
  Nodes with location, size, child nodes, own content visible or hidden
