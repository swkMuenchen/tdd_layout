Layout basically places some hierarchically orginized rectangles based on their attributes.
Relevant attributes in Freeplane are
free positioned (boolean)
shiftX, shiftY, Vgap (numbers)
and summary (boolean)
The shifts means how a node is placed related to its "zero" position,
the Vgap means additional vertical gap for child nodes
There are also clouds which make nodes use more space depending on a cloud type and level
Filtered (hidden) content means no own content is visible (its size = (0,0)) but the chidren can be.
Children are hidden for folded nodes
Location of node content relative to its parent node does not change if folding state is changed. 
Consider space around.
Consider zoom

Single child node is shifted by 2pt from center. (Based on zoom). 

layout process:
Precondition: every child tree has been laid out 
  its size is known
  its node (text/objects) and its child trees are laid out and put to the right positions
Action:
  the tree is laid out	by 
  	defining positions of its root node and its child trees
  	and defining its size 

Names:
  
  Trees with position, size, child trees 
  Node = content,  visible or hidden 

Use "inner bounding box" for tree layout calculations,
and add a method for calculating "outer bounding box" by adding space around
