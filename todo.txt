Layout basically places some hierarchically orginized rectangles based on their attributes.
Relevant attributes in Freeplane are
floating (boolean)
shiftX, shiftY, Vgap (numbers)
and summary (boolean)
The shifts means how a node is placed related to its "zero" position,
the Vgap means additional vertical gap for child nodes
There are also clouds which make nodes use more space depending on a cloud type and level
Filtered (hidden) content means no own content is visible (its size = (0,0)) but the chidren can be.
Children are hidden for folded nodes
Location of node content relative to its parent node does not change if folding state is changed. 
Consider space around
Consider zoom

Single child node is shifted by 2pt from center. (Based on zoom). 

layout process:
Precondition: every child node has been layed out 
  its size is known
  its content (text/objects) and its child nodes are layed out and put to the right positions
Action:
  current node is layed out	by 
  	defining position of its content and child nodes 
  	and defining its size 
  
Names:
  Tree
  Nodes with position, size, child nodes 
  ContentNode = LeafNode,  visible or hidden 
  MapNode = ContainerNode
